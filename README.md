# Markovifying Tate
This project featured at the Science Slam competition 2023 organized by Uni WÃ¼rzburg. The project explores how Markovify, a text-generation tool based on Markov chains, can predict and generate a philosophical synthesis when fed both classical AI research papers and Andrew Tate's motivational speeches.


Markovify predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous word using a Markov chain, where each word's likelihood depends only on the word that came before it. The first word is chosen from a set of all possible starting words, typically those that appear at the beginning of sentences in the input data, ensuring coherence in the generated text. This process relies on probabilities derived from the frequency of word pairs in the source text.
# meme me
Edtech companies often use educational memes on social media as part of their branding strategy. These memes are effective for engaging with audiences and increasing visibility. However, maintaining a daily posting schedule poses challenges. The meme creators, often individual meme makers or "trollers," struggle with consistency due to time constraints and the difficulty of continuously generating creative ideas. A frequent posting schedule is crucial as it leads to higher engagement and, consequently, a larger audience.

Solution: The proposed solution is the use of AI-assisted meme creation to sustain the quality and frequency of posts.
