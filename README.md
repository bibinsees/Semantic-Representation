# Markovifying Tate
This project featured at the Science Slam competition 2023 organized by Uni WÃ¼rzburg. The project explores how Markovify, a text-generation tool based on Markov chains, can predict and generate a philosophical synthesis when fed both classical AI research papers and Andrew Tate's motivational speeches.


Markovify predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous word using a Markov chain, where each word's likelihood depends only on the word that came before it. The first word is chosen from a set of all possible starting words, typically those that appear at the beginning of sentences in the input data, ensuring coherence in the generated text. This process relies on probabilities derived from the frequency of word pairs in the source text.
